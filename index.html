  <p>While building a software application, the question arises where will you store <br> your data and how? The traditional approach is a simple text file or CSV file <br> which is not a good choice in todayâ€™s big data world. The solution is
    Database <br> Management System(DBMS) which allows different user application programs <br> to concurrently access the same Database.</p>
  <br>
  <p>A Database Management system(DBMS) is a simpler, easier, reliable, faster, <br> secure, and powerful software tool for Storing, Managing, and Retrieving data. <br> There are two types of Databases: Relational and Non-Relational Databases. <br>
    An example of a Relational Database is SQL Server and a Non-Relational <br> Database is MongoDB. We will be discussing the key differences between <br> MongoDB vs SQL Server in this blog.</p>

  <h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
  <p> <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> is an open-source, cross-platform, document-oriented, and non- <br>elational database system. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and was <br> first released on February 11, 2009. Its stable
    release is <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0/"></a> MongoDB 5.0.5 released on 6 <br> December 2021. It is written in different programming languages <br> like <a

  <p>MongoDB is a NoSQL Server in which data is stored in <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON#:~:text=BSON%20(%2F%CB%88bi%CB%90s,a%20computer%20data%20interchange%20format.&text=It%20is%20a%20binary%20form,originated%20in%202009%20at%20MongoDB.">BSON</a> (Binary JSON) <br> documents and each
    document is essentially built on a key-value pair structure. As <br> MongoDB easily stores schemaless data, make it appropriate for capturing data <br> whose structure is not known. This document-oriented approach is designed to <br> offer a
    richer experience with modern programming techniques. </p>

  <h3> <strong>Features of MongoDB</strong> </h3>
  <img width="400" height="150" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hevo/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1644486462/hevo-learn/mongodb-architecure/mongodb-architecure.png?_i=AA" alt="Image Source">
  <pre>    Image Source </pre>
  <br>
  Main features of MongoDB which make it unique are:
  <h3> <b>High Performance</b> </h3>
  <p>Data operations on MongoDB are fast and easy because of their NoSQL nature.<br> Data can be quickly stored, manipulated, and retrieved without any compromise <br> on data integrity.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Scalibility</h3>
  <p>In the Big Data era, MongoDB data can be distributed across a cluster of machines <br> quickly and equally, free of bulkiness. The scalability of MongoDB handles a <br> growing amount of data capably. <a
      href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/sharding/">Sharding</a> is a process in MongoDB used to <br> horizontally scale the data across multiple servers when the size of data increases.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Availability</h3>
  <p>Data is highly available with MongoDB as it makes multiple copies of the same <br> data and sends copies of data across different servers. In case any server fails, <br> data can be retrieved from another server without delay.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Flexibility</h3>
  <p>MongoDB can easily be combined with different Database Management Systems, <br> both SQL and NoSQL types. Document-oriented structure makes MongoDB <br> schema dynamically flexible and different types of data can be easily stored and <br>
    manipulated.</p>
  <br>

      Server</a>is a Relational Database Management System(RDBMS). It is also <br> known as Microsoft SQL Server or sometimes as MSSQL. SQL Server is <br> developed by Microsoft and was initially releases on April 24, 1989. Its stable <br> release is
    SQL Server 2019 released on 4 November 2019. MSSQL is written <br> in programming languages like C and C++.</p>
  <p>SQL Server is based on the relational model introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd">E.F.Codd.</a> In RDBMS data is stored in tables and the relationships among the data are maintained between tables. In tables, data
    is organized in rows and columns format. Each column represents a particular field or feature and each row in the table represents an entry or a record. </p>
  <p>Microsoft SQL Server offers a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2017?view=sql-server-2017#includessnoversionincludesssnoversion-mdmd-editions">:</a>Express, Enterprise, Standard, Web,
    Developer. Express edition is freeware for <br> small and entry-level applications while others are licensed-based editions <br> used for bigger projects on commercial levels based on the service required. <br> SQL Server supports XML data type
    format and dynamic management views. </p>

  <p>The following section talks about the primary differences between MongoDB <br> vs SQL Server in detail:</p>
  <br>
  <h3> <b>Developed by and Initial Release</b> </h3>
  <p>MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and was initially released on <br> February 11, 2009.</p>
  <p>SQL Server is developed by Microsoft Corporation and was initially released on <br> April 24, 1989.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> <b>Database Model</b> </h3>
  <p>MongoDB is a Non-Relational Database based on a document-oriented <br> structure that internally is based on a key-value structure.</p>
  <p>SQL Server is a Relational Database based on relatable structured tables with <br> various rows and columns.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> <b>Implementation Language</b> </h3>
  <p>MongoDB is implemented in JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, C++, C, Ruby, Perl, <br> C, C++ whereas SQL Server is implemented in C and C++.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> <b>License</b> </h3>
  <p>MongoDB is an Open-Source DBMS whereas a SQL Server license is required <br> for commercial purposes.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> <b>Data Schema</b> </h3>
  <p>MongoDB has a flexible dynamic schema that can easily be changed with the <br> evolution of data, application, or business</p>
  <p>SQL Server has a fixed Schema that is predefined before inserting any data. <br> Fixed schema means schema canâ€™t be changed as data, application, or <br> business requirement evolves.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> <b>Query Language</b> </h3>
  <p>MongoDB uses MongoDB Query Language to query unstructured data from <br> the database.</p>
  <p>SQL Server uses SQL Query Language to Create Tables, Insert, Fetch or <br> Update data in the database.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> <b>Scalability</b> </h3>
  <p>MongoDB supports Horizontal Scaling in which data is distributed across <br> clusters. The Sharding process is used to implement horizontal scaling which <br> results in an always-up server.</p>
  <p>SQL Server supports vertical scaling which is the traditional approach. In <br> vertical scaling, physical or virtual resources are added to the hosting server of <br> the database.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> <b>Map Reduce</b> </h3>
  <p>MongoDB supports a data processing algorithm for concentrating large <br> volumes of data into aggregated results. MongoDB provides the MapReduce <br> database command to perform map-reduce operations.</p>
  <p>SQL Server does not support the Map-Reduce method.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> <b>Joins</b> </h3>
  <p>MongoDB is a non-relational database so it does not support JOINs whereas <br> SQL Server used JOINS to retrieve data from multiple tables which are joined.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> <b>Transaction</b> </h3>
  <p>MongoDB provides multi-document <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/basics/acid-transactions">ACID transactions</a> (ACID is an acronym for <br> Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) with snapshot isolation, which <br> ensures that the
    database is in a valid state after a set of database operations <br> is executed.</p>
  <p>MS SQL Server also provides ACID transactions with data integrity without <br> snapshot isolation.</p>
  <br>
  <h3> <b>XML support</b> </h3>
  <p>MongoDB doesnâ€™t support XML structured documents. Documents in <br> MongoDB are stored in BSON format.</p>
  <p>SQL Server provides support for XML structured data. XML support is <br> integrated into all the components of SQL Server.</p>
  <br>
  <h2> <em> <strong>Conclusion</strong> </em> </h2>
  <p>MongoDB is a database that is more advanced and capable of handling big <br> data with dynamic schema features. SQL Server is an RDBMS that is used to <br> manage the relational database system and offers end-to-end business data <br> solutions.
    In the case of unstructured data MongoDB is a good choice. Also, <br> MongoDB is open source which makes it readily available.</p>
  <p>No doubt SQL Server is going strong for many years but now with the era of <br> Big Data, MongoDB seems to have a bright future. But, that doesnâ€™t mean SQL <br> Server will be completely eradicated. The choice of database between <br> MongoDB
    and SQL Server is completely specific to the userâ€™s needs.</p>
